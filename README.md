# Fraud-Transaction-Detection-Using-ML, check 'Code' branch for code

Fraud detection in financial transactions has become increasingly essential with the growing reliance on digital payment platforms and the sophistication of fraudulent schemes. This report presents a machine learning-based framework utilizing a stacked ensemble model that integrates **Random Forest, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression classifiers** to enhance detection accuracy. The model was trained and evaluated on a **large real-world financial dataset**, allowing for comprehensive learning across diverse transaction patterns. To further improve model performance, the study applies techniques such as Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (**SMOTE**) for class balancing, feature selection to reduce redundancy, and **cross-validation** to ensure generalization. The layered architecture enables the ensemble to leverage the strengths of each base model, improving its ability to identify fraudulent activities effectively. This approach demonstrates that ensemble-based methods can significantly contribute to building robust, scalable, and intelligentfraud detection systems suitable for modern financial applications.
